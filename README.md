**MY NOTES :)**

In this lecture we learned new two thing :
1. TDD (test driven development) :which is a practice  to test our code, by writing the test before our code and then we can writing our own code and  correct it   

2. CD/CI : (CI => continous integration ,CD => continous deployment ) and this is a method where we can  frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run.
